  Radiomics pre-checks involve identifying the optimal parameters for your
  radiomics study. While not mandatory for feature extraction, it is a
  recommended step.

Since high variation in imaging parameters will impact robustness of radiomic features, the following code will assist you in identifying optimal intensity ranges and voxel dimension re-scaling parameters for a specific dataset. For further insights, refer to the following [article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmp.2021.07.023) that delves into the impact of intensity window on the stability of radiomic features for CT data.
