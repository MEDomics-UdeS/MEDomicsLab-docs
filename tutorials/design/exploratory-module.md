## Available tools

All these tools can be used to explore your data and generate reports. You can use them to compare different datasets and generate reports for each one of them. You can also use them to generate reports for a single dataset. These processes can also run in parallel.

### [1. SweetViz](https://github.com/fbdesignpro/sweetviz)
