# MEDimage

MEDimage is an all-in-one software, based on two integral components, a [code-free interface](https://github.com/MEDomics-UdeS/medimage-app/) and a [code-base package](https://github.com/MEDomics-UdeS/MEDimage), that facilitates medical image processing, radiomics feature extraction, and model training. It is part of MEDomicsLab, but it also comes in a standalone version available at [medimage.app](https://medimage.app/). There, you will find all the resources needed to start using the module. Enjoy :heart:!

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that the standalone version is the most up-to-date, and we highly recommend using it.
