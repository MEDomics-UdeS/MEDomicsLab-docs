Thank you all for your participation in the _MEDomicsLab Testing Phase_! We created a form to collect your feedback on the MEDomicsLab application and the Testing Phase. Feel free to fill it out, even if you did not complete all the steps. This will help us improve the application and organize the next Testing Phase :wink:.
