# Step 8: Challenge

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/MicrosoftTeams-image (7).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Step 8 - Challenge</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
This step will require you to download the new learning set that we sent you (_MEDomicsLab\_TestingPhase\_Step8.zip_). This set comprises four datasets (one for each time point), combining the learning and holdout sets obtained in [_Step 4 - Explore Data_](step-4.md).

To avoid confusion among all the datasets from the beginning of the Testing Phase, we recommend creating a new workspace for this step containing only the new learning set.

An invitation to access the _MEDomicsLab\_TestingPhase\_Step8.zip_ data has been sent via email.
{% endhint %}

Welcome to the final step of the MEDomicsLab Testing Phase! We appreciate your engagement throughout this journey.

In _Step 8 - Challenge_, you will leverage the knowledge you have gained from the MEDomicsLab platform in the preceding steps of the Testing Phase. You are the master here :clap:!

The objective here is that participants design their own model via the use of the [_Machine Learning (ML) Module_](https://medomics-udes.gitbook.io/medomicslab-docs/tutorials/development/learning-module)_._ These models will be evaluated by the MEDomicsLab team using a fresh, private holdout set from the [MIMIC](https://mimic.mit.edu/) database.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Considering the insights we have gained during the Testing Phase, we have now updated the rules for this step. In contrast to what we initially planned, there will be a single challenge that involves manipulations in the _Machine Learning (ML) Module_ only.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
We are continuously working on enhancing the MEDomicsLab platform, and we would like to inform you that there may still be some missing options and tooltips in the Learning Module, which we intend to implement in the future.
{% endhint %}

## Recommendations

Before proceeding with _Step 8 - Challenge_ of the MEDomicsLab Testing Phase, we recommend revisiting the documentation related to [_Step 6 - Create Model_](https://medomics-udes.gitbook.io/medomicslab-docs/test-with-mimic/step-6).

## Instructions for Step 8 - Challenge

* Download the new learning set provided in _MEDomicsLab\_TestingPhase\_Step8.zip_.
* Create a model similarly to the one we created in [_Step 6 - Create Model_](https://medomics-udes.gitbook.io/medomicslab-docs/test-with-mimic/step-6) using the [_Machine Learning (ML) Module_](https://medomics-udes.gitbook.io/medomicslab-docs/tutorials/development/learning-module). Follow these guidelines for creating your best possible model:
  * Train, optimize, and test models.
  * Compare different data combinations **using **_**Time point 1**_** and **_**Time point 2**_** only**.
  * Choose a learning hypothesis and create a final model.
* Once you have trained your best model, send it to [medomics.info@gmail.com](mailto:medomics.info@gmail.com) with "Step 8 - Challenge | Submission" as the Subject of your email. You are allowed to send multiple submissions, but please note that we will only evaluate your latest submission.&#x20;
  * If you wish, you can let us know in the email the name that we should use for the public ranking of your submission (e.g. _MLrocks_ :smile:). If not specified, we will use your full name.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Even if we provide you with data for the fourth time point, the model you submit must only take into account _Time point 1_ and/or _Time point 2_.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
For this _ML Challenge_, most of your work will therefore be done inside the [_Machine Learning (ML) Module_](https://medomics-udes.gitbook.io/medomicslab-docs/tutorials/development/learning-module).  However, you are also welcome to use the other capabilities of the MEDomicsLab platform. For example, you may want to use the [_Exploratory Module_](https://medomics-udes.gitbook.io/medomicslab-docs/tutorials/design/exploratory-module) to continue to gain useful insights about the dataset prior to the learning step.&#x20;

However, to facilitate the Evaluation process of the models submitted by the participants, **we please ask the following:**

* _**Only use**_ the data we provided in the  _MEDomicsLab\_TestingPhase\_Step8.zip file._
  * Therefore, you should not be able to use the _Extraction Module_ or the _MEDprofiles_ package_._&#x20;
* _**Do not change**_ column names in the data we provided (this includes the use of the Groupping/Tagging tool).
* _**Do not merge**_ the time point CSV files together.&#x20;
* _**Dot not use**_ the "Transform Columns tool".&#x20;
* _**Do not use**_ the "PCA" utility of the "Feature Reduction tool".
* If you use the "Spearman" utility of the "Feature Reduction tool", **make sure to keep the **_**subject\_id**_** and **_**target**_** columns in your dataset** by enabling the "Merge unselected columns in the result dataset" and "Keep target in dataset" options.
  * Note that you new dataset will be placed in the _reduced\_features_ folder and that you will have to move it in your _learning_ folder to retrieve it in the [_Learning Module_](https://medomics-udes.gitbook.io/medomicslab-docs/tutorials/development/learning-module).

If these instructions are not followed, we will not be able to evaluate your submission, and it will unfortunately be discarded.&#x20;

Also, note that to create a model in the [_Learning Module_](https://medomics-udes.gitbook.io/medomicslab-docs/tutorials/development/learning-module), your CSV files must be placed under a "learning" folder and have the prefix "TX\_" (e.g., _T1\_new\_learning_) as in the data we provided you.

{% hint style="info" %}
After the conclusion of the Testing Phase on May 13, we will evaluate the performance of the models submitted by all participants and establish a ranking through an evaluation using our private holdout set.

Following this, we will make the ranking public and announce the winner of the _ML Challenge_ :tada:. At that time, we will also reveal the winner of the _Bug Finder_ _Challenge_ :smile:!
