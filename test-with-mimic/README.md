# ðŸ“„ Testing phase with MIMIC

## Overview

During the Winter 2024 semester, the first Testing Phase of [MEDomicsLab](https://github.com/MEDomics-UdeS/MEDomicsLab) will take place via a series of tutorials. For an overview of the vision that we have for the platform, please [go here](../#an-overview-of-medomicslab)

We would love to have you join the effort and provide feedback during this Testing Phase, prior to a first official release of MEDomicsLab! Our intent is to properly recognize all the participants of the Testing Phase when the first official release will come.

**See the list of participants** [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w4n2gygstxnrFSzAi1LqGsxgCVYa1Odyb8vl9huu-kU/).

We anticipate that the **participation in the Testing Phase will involve 1 hour of work per week for 17 consecutive weeks, starting January 15, 2024.** We are thinking of involving some mini-challenges with prizes, so this could be fun! Please also note that no programming is involved and that the tutorials can be performed on a laptop.

The participation in the Testing Phase will involve the use of data from the [MIMIC database](https://mimic.mit.edu/). **We have already processed** the MIMIC data for the purpose of the Testing Phase. To share this processed data with you, we need you to complete the following:

1. Become a credential user of MIMIC: [https://physionet.org/settings/credentialing/](https://physionet.org/settings/credentialing/)
2. Complete the CITI Course: [https://physionet.org/about/citi-course/](https://physionet.org/about/citi-course/)
3. Sign the following Physionet data use agreements:
   * MIMIC-IV: [https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimiciv/2.2/](https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimiciv/2.2/)
   * MIMIC-CXR: [https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/](https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/)
   * MIMIC-IV-ED: [https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimic-iv-ed/2.2/](https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimic-iv-ed/2.2/)
   * MIMIC-IV-Note: [https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimic-iv-note/2.2/](https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimic-iv-note/2.2/)
4. Send us the 5 forms (CITI Course certification + 4 signed data use agreements) to medomics.info@gmail.com

This process will take some time, but we assure you it will be worth it!

Please also note that an **Information Session** about the Testing Phase is scheduled on **December 15, 2023 at 10AM to 12PM Eastern Time**. You do not have to attend that Information Session to participate in the Testing Phase, but we encourage you to be there.
