# ðŸ“„ Testing Phase with MIMIC

## Overview

During the Winter 2024 semester, the first Testing Phase of [MEDomicsLab](https://github.com/MEDomics-UdeS/MEDomicsLab) will take place via a series of tutorials. For an overview of the vision that we have for the platform, please [go here](../#an-overview-of-medomicslab).

We would love to have you join the effort and provide feedback during this Testing Phase, prior to a first official release of MEDomicsLab! Our intent is to properly recognize all the participants of the Testing Phase when the first official release will come.

We anticipate that the **participation in the Testing Phase will involve 1 hour of work per week for 17 consecutive weeks, starting January 15, 2024.** We are thinking of involving some mini-challenges with prizes, so this could be fun! Please also note that no programming is involved and that the tutorials can be performed on a laptop.
