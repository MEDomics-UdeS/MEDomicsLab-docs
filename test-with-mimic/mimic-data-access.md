# MIMIC data access

The participation in the Testing Phase will involve the use of data from the [MIMIC database](https://mimic.mit.edu/). **We have already processed** the MIMIC data for the purpose of the Testing Phase. To share this processed data with you, we need you to complete the following:

1. Become a credential user of MIMIC: [https://physionet.org/settings/credentialing/](https://physionet.org/settings/credentialing/)
2. Complete the CITI Course: [https://physionet.org/about/citi-course/](https://physionet.org/about/citi-course/)
3. Sign the following Physionet data use agreements:
   * MIMIC-IV: [https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimiciv/2.2/](https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimiciv/2.2/)
   * MIMIC-CXR: [https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/](https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/)
   * MIMIC-IV-ED: [https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimic-iv-ed/2.2/](https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimic-iv-ed/2.2/)
   * MIMIC-IV-Note: [https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimic-iv-note/2.2/](https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimic-iv-note/2.2/)
4. Send us the 5 forms (CITI Course certification + 4 signed data use agreements) to medomics.info@gmail.com

This process will take some time, but we assure you it will be worth it!
