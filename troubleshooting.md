* Check if anaconda3 or miniconda3 exists
* Check if conda environnement exists
  * Open a conda terminal
  * `conda env list`
  * Do you see a conda environnement named med\_conda\_env ?
    * yes ? Check environnement variable MED\_ENV on your system
    * no ? Did you make this step -> [#2.-unzip-the-python-environment-installer-1](quick-start.md#2.-unzip-the-python-environment-installer-1 "mention")

<summary>Go server is working properly but I got errors when clicking on process buttons</summary>

Your python environnement could have problems.

#### Test the environnement variable MED\_ENV

on WINDOWS:\
open a cmd terminal( `ðŸªŸ + cmd`) and write `set MED_ENV`&#x20;

on LINUX and MACOS:\
Open a terminal and write `echo $MED_ENV`

**It should print a path to where your** [**conda** ](https://www.anaconda.com/)**env is installed.** \
If not:&#x20;

<summary>MacOS: the app does not want to launch and/or the app seems buggy when opening multiple <strong>tabs</strong>. <em>KNOWN ISSUE FOR MAC USERS AT UNIVERSITÃ‰ DE SHERBROOKE WITH THE TRELLIX ANTIVIRUS.</em></summary>

Problem description:&#x20;

The app seems to be stuck at startup. Or after startup, when opening multiple tabs (e.g. two different csv files), the app turns all white.&#x20;

***

Probable cause:&#x20;

If you have an insitutitonal antivirus like Trellix at UniversitÃ© de Sherbrooke, we believe the firewall of Trellix prevents MEDomicsLab to run properly. We hope the problem will be solved once we certify (signing Mac software) the MEDomicsLab app with Apple (_work in progress_).

***

Workaround:&#x20;

If you encounter a similar issue, and you have an antivirus installed on your computer, we recommend that you disable it when using MEDomicsLab. For Mac users at UniversitÃ© de Sherbrooke with Trellix, one way to momentarily disable the utilities of Trellix is to:

1. Go to _System Settings_, _Privacy & Security,_ _Full Disk Access_.
2. Disable the following six extensions: _fmpd_, _VShieldScanManager_, _VShieldScanner_, _masvc_, _TrellixEndpointSecurity_, _TrellixNetworkExtension_.
3. Restart yur computer.

Of course, once you are done working with MEDomicsLab, we recommend you enable again your antivirus! For Mac users at UnversitÃ© de Sherbrooke with Trellix, this would mean to enable again the six extensions above, and to restart your computer.&#x20;
