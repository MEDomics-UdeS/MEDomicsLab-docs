<summary>Go server not working ?</summary>

#### Check server's status:

Open the app's settings page and check if the Go server is running:

<summary>Go server is working properly but I got errors when clicking on process buttons</summary>

Your python environment could have problems.

#### Make sure your application's Python environment path is set to the installed _MEDomics_ python environment, if not, you can change is as follows:

![](.gitbook/assets/AppsPythonEnv.png)

You can check your python environment's path using the following:

* **For windows**: use the command `where python` and select the path in the `.medomics` folder.
* **For Linux and MACOS**: use the command `whereis python` and select the one inside `.medomics` folder. If you don't see any path with the `.medomics` folder, find it manually and export it to your `PATH` environment variable using the command: `export PATH=/path/to/your/usr/.medomics/python/bin:$PATH`

If none of the aforementioned steps help solve your problem, please [contact us](forms/contact-us.md).

<summary>MacOS: the app does not want to launch and/or the app seems buggy when opening multiple <strong>tabs</strong>. <em>KNOWN ISSUE FOR MAC USERS AT UNIVERSIT√â DE SHERBROOKE WITH THE TRELLIX ANTIVIRUS.</em></summary>

Problem description:&#x20;

The app seems to be stuck at startup. Or after startup, when opening multiple tabs (e.g. two different csv files), the app turns all white.&#x20;

***

Probable cause:&#x20;

If you have an insitutitonal antivirus like Trellix at Universit√© de Sherbrooke, we believe the firewall of Trellix prevents MEDomicsLab to run properly. We hope the problem will be solved once we certify (signing Mac software) the MEDomicsLab app with Apple (_work in progress_).

***

Workaround:&#x20;

If you encounter a similar issue, and you have an antivirus installed on your computer, we recommend that you disable it when using MEDomicsLab. For Mac users at Universit√© de Sherbrooke with Trellix, one way to momentarily disable the utilities of Trellix is to:

1. Go to _System Settings_, _Privacy & Security,_ _Full Disk Access_.
2. Disable the following six extensions: _fmpd_, _VShieldScanManager_, _VShieldScanner_, _masvc_, _TrellixEndpointSecurity_, _TrellixNetworkExtension_.
3. Restart yur computer.

Of course, once you are done working with MEDomicsLab, we recommend you enable again your antivirus! For Mac users at Unversit√© de Sherbrooke with Trellix, this would mean to enable again the six extensions above, and to restart your computer.&#x20;

<summary>ImportError: cannot import name 'dtreeviz' from 'dtreeviz.trees'</summary>

This error occurs when the wrong version of [dtreeviz ](https://github.com/parrt/dtreeviz)is installed. Please refer to the requirement files in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MEDomics-UdeS/MEDomicsLab) to install the right version (v1.4.1 is the one usually used).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Columns missing in evaluation and application modules</summary>

The error message typically appears as `['column_1', 'column_2', 'column_3'] not in index`. This issue occurs when column names in the file used for model training contain spaces (e.g., "_column 1_" instead of "_column\_1_"). To prevent this, avoid using column names with spaces. While the code should handle this automatically, please [open an issue](https://github.com/MEDomics-UdeS/MEDomicsLab/issues/new/choose) on our GitHub if you encounter this error.

<details>

<summary>Process stopped with toast message: "<em>Exit status 1</em>"</summary>

This error usually occurs due to a missing Python library (shown as a `ModuleNotFoundError`). To resolve it, first open the console (press **CTRL + Shift + I**) and identify the missing package name in the full error message. Then, install the specified package version from the requirements file on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MEDomics-UdeS/MEDomicsLab). For a more comprehensive solution, compare your installed packages with those listed in the requirements file on [GitHub ](https://github.com/MEDomics-UdeS/MEDomicsLab)and install any missing packages to prevent this error in the future.

If the missing package is not listed in our GitHub requirements, please [contact us](forms/contact-us.md) or [open an issue](https://github.com/MEDomics-UdeS/MEDomicsLab/issues/new/choose) so we can add it.

<summary>LightGBM Model is taking forever to train</summary>

This is a common issue in Ubuntu that occurs when training a lightGBM  model using `n_jobs=-1`. When you set `n_jobs=-1`, the process can sometimes hang or slow down due to how the library manages parallel threads on certain systems. Here are some common reasons for this behavior:

1. **CPU Thread Saturation**: Setting `n_jobs=-1` tells LightGBM to use all available CPU cores. On Linux systems, particularly with high core counts, this can overwhelm the CPU scheduler, leading to inefficient thread management, especially if other processes are running concurrently.
2. **OpenMP Configuration**: LightGBM uses OpenMP for parallelism, and certain configurations of OpenMP on Linux can lead to deadlocks or excessive thread contention. This issue can be specific to how OpenMP handles threads in certain Linux distributions, including Ubuntu. More details here: [https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/FAQ.html#lightgbm-hangs-when-multithreading-openmp-and-using-forking-in-linux-at-the-same-time](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/FAQ.html#lightgbm-hangs-when-multithreading-openmp-and-using-forking-in-linux-at-the-same-time)
3. **Memory Bandwidth and Latency**: Using all CPU cores can lead to high memory bandwidth consumption. If LightGBM needs more memory per thread than available, this can slow down training significantly. Lowering the `n_jobs` setting reduces the number of simultaneous threads and can help manage memory load.
4. **Compatibility with Specific Libraries**: LightGBM's multithreading may not work smoothly with all versions of system libraries on Ubuntu, such as `libgomp` (GNU OpenMP). Sometimes, upgrading or downgrading certain libraries (e.g., `libgomp1`) can resolve this issue.

#### Solutions:

* **Limit `n_jobs`**: Set `n_jobs` to a smaller number (e.g., 4 or 8), which often yields good performance without overloading the system.
* **Upgrade/Downgrade System Libraries**: Update your OpenMP libraries.

You can test different `n_jobs` values to find the optimal setting, which balances speed and stability.
