# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Welcome to MEDomicsLab! Here you'll find all the documentation you need to get up and running with our application.

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the [_**UnitÃ© de Soutien SSA QuÃ©bec (USSAQ)**_](https://ssaquebec.ca/en/) for their invaluable help and funding throughout the MEDomicsLab project. Their support has been instrumental in enabling the development of this crucial platform for medical data analysis and machine learning. With USSAQ's contribution, MEDomicsLab is poised to make a significant impact on improving the healthcare system in Quebec by making it continuously learn and improve. For more info about USSAQ mission and vision, please visit the following page: [_**USSAQ Vision and Mission**_](https://ssaquebec.ca/en/the-unit/vision-and-mission/)_**.**_

## Conclusions

* **We envision the MEDomicsLab platform to become a tool that will improve the synergy among medical AI research teams by:**
  * Empowering clinicians to design their own experiments (front-end)&#x20;
  * Allowing computer scientists to quickly adapt experiments (front-end)&#x20;
  * Refining the previously designed experiments (back-end)
* **Different levels of complexity/flexibility of usage include:**
  * Built-in pipelines in a user-friendly interface (front-end)&#x20;
  * Customizable pipelines with setting options (front-end)&#x20;
  * Code generation (front-end)&#x20;
  * Modular code libraries in Python (back-end)
* We invite partners to follow the developments on [our GitHub](https://github.com/MEDomics-UdeS/MEDomicsLab) and to prepare for the [testing phase ](test-with-mimic/)in the Winter 2024 semester (\~1 hour per week).
