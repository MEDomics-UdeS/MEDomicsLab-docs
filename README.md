## Conclusions

* **We envision the MEDomicsLab platform to become a tool that will improve the synergy among medical AI research teams by:**
  * Empowering clinicians to design their own experiments (front-end)&#x20;
  * Allowing computer scientists to quickly adapt experiments (front-end)&#x20;
  * Refining the previously designed experiments (back-end)
* **Different levels of complexity/flexibility of usage include:**
  * Built-in pipelines in a user-friendly interface (front-end)&#x20;
  * Customizable pipelines with setting options (front-end)&#x20;
  * Code generation (front-end)&#x20;
  * Modular code libraries in Python (back-end)
* We invite partners to follow the developments on [our GitHub](https://github.com/MEDomics-UdeS/MEDomicsLab) and to prepare for the [testing phase ](test-with-mimic/)in the Winter 2024 semester (\~1 hour per week).
