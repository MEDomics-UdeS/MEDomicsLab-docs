Hi !,  its Ai voice generator Andrew, I will be talking on behalf of Guillaume Blain to present the Application module! This is
where you can reap the fruits of your efforts and see the results of your work by using your created models to predict an outcome on new data !

First you click on the icon here.

Then, we will select a model that we have created in the previous module. For this tutorial, i will use the Extra trees classifier

after selecting a model, it asks you to enter values for each colummns on which the model has been trained on. 

when filling all the required fields, this button will be enabled and you should be able to predict the outcome.

Because it is kind of time consuming to fill every columns and in some cases with hundred of features, it can quickly become a nightmare, we will use an other option.

With this button, we can change the entry mode to File entry. So this second mode allows you to enter a csv file in respect of the model's columns.

For this tutorial, I prepared a csv file with one patient that look like that:

So i will use this one and then, hit the predict button.

As you can see, it generated a prediction for this patient with a new and freezed column at the end containing the prediction.

And that's it for the application module, I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and see you in the next one !
