Hi its Ai voice generator Andrew, I will be talking on behalf of Guillaume Blain to present the learning module!

So first thing first, click on this icon.

Then select the "EXPERIMENTS" folder and click on the "create scene" button.

You can now enter a name for your page, i will use "scene_1" and then click on "create"

As you can see, a new folder named "experiment" is created and inside, you can see the scene you created.
A scene is composed of a "models" folder, a "notenbooks" folder and the scene file; a .medml file

You can now double click on it to open the scene.

On this page, you have a button to open a menu with available nodes.

you have a "see results" button but we have to run an experiment to use it.

on the yop right, we have utilities like a dropdown to change machine learning type (either classification or regression for now)

We also have some useful buttons like "run", "clear", "save" and "import" 

We can now build our scene by dragging some nodes and dropping them in the working area

Now that the dataset node is added, we can add a model and a "train model" node. We can connect the model and the dataset to the train model node

then, we add an "analyze" node

now that every node is added, we can start editing their options. let's start by changing dataset input type to "custom data file" and choose a dataset and the associated target

For the moment, every thing is setup and ready to be run so click on the run button to start the experiment

you can now relax, take a break, go make some coffee... the experiment is running

In the meantime, you can save your scene by clicking on the save button

nice ! so as you can see the experiment is finished

here is the results file, a .med ml res file.

now the see results button is enabled, so click on it 

resize the results panel and click on the fit button to correctly see your scene, You just run your first experiment, enjoy your results !
