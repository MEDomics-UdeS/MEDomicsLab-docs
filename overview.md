# ðŸ‘€ Overview

## 1. Set your workspace

The application needs a workspace to run.

_At first, we recommend you create an empty folder (named "**Workspace**" for example) and choose it as your workspace directory._

{% hint style="info" %}
The DATA folder is where you will store your datasets&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The EXPERIMENTS folder is where the experiments, the models and the results will be stored
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
The folders DATA and EXPERIMENTS cannot be deleted inside the application, we **strongly** recommend you to avoid erasing them from outside of the application
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The .medomics folder is used by application to store all the infos of the workspace, don't touch it if you want the app to run smoothly :wink:
